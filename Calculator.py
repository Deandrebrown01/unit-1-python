Number1=float(input("Enter the number you want: "))
Number=float(input("Enter the second number:"))

choice=input("What operation do you want to do?")

if choice == 'multiplication':
    print(Number * Number1)
elif choice =="addition":
    print(Number + Number1)
elif choice=='division':
    print(Number/Number1)
elif choice=='floor division':
    print(Number//Number1)
elif choice== 'Remainder':
    print(Number%Number1)
else:
    print("This operation is not in this code")

# First I made two float variables so that the user can enter two numbers. Then I made another variable called choice which asks the user what operation do they want to use. I used an if statement and then I used if the persons choice equaled to that operation print the two numbers with the operation sign that goes with that operation. I did that for all of them, then for the code to say this operation is not on there I made an else statement. Afterwards I printed this operation is not on this code. This is how I completed this task.
